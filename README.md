# rainmanland
A self-scheduling calendar and route-optimization web application for rainmanland.com

## Deploying changes to the live site
We will use pull deployments to safely update the live site. With a React app hosted using nginx, the process looks something like this:
1. A team member commits new changes on their local machine
2. They push or submit a pull request to the GitHub repo, depending on the branch you made changes to (*main* requires pull request).
3. Somebody will ssh into the EC2 instance and pull the changes from GitHub into the repo on the EC2 instance (`~/team-wallaby/rainmanland`)
4. Inside the repo on the EC2 instance, use the command `npm run build` to compile the app into a build folder
5. Copy the contents from `build` into `/var/www/rainmanland/html`
6. Test all the nginx config files with `nginx -t`
7. Restart the nginx server with `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
8. The changes should now be live.

**Note**: this doesn't need to be done very often. To check how changes look, we will usually just run `npm start` on our local machines to take a look in the browser.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
